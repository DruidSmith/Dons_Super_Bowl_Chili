## An Open Source Chili Recipe ##

Chili is one of my favorite foods of all time. I don't have a single recipe that I can say is my favorite, as I like to experiment with various ingredients to see what their effect is on the final product. This year (2014) I've started fresh with a new **base recipe** that I hope to tweak over the next few months.

In the past I had a few requirements for my chili.
These requirements no longer apply:

- First - chili does not have beans

As you can see below, this rule has been broken here. The reasons are many. The veggies serve as a sweetening agent balancing out the heat and spice of the chili. The veggies are a cheap addition. Meat is expensive, and to rely on meat to add volume to your chili makes for a very expensive dish. I have caved to the desires of my family. They like veggies in their chili. I've learned to accept that.


- Second - chili must be hot

I've relaxed my chili requirements in this area, too. I still like hot chili, but I also like to share it with my family. I get a lot more enjoyment from making chili my friends and family will enjoy, much more than I do from eating  my chili alone.

So, here's the recipe. This is my first batch, and it will change before I make another, I guarantee it.
Feel free to make suggestions. I'm open to any and all ideas.

### Ingredients ###

- 1 lb. Thick Sliced or chunk Bacon, chopped into small pieces
- 1 lb. smoked pork shoulder, 1/2-inch cubes
